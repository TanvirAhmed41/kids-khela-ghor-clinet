          Q1:What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and
          where should we store them on the client-side?
        </p>
        <p className="">
          <span className="font-semibold text-xl">Ans:</span>
          <br />
          An access token is a short-lived credential used to access protected
          resources, proving authorization. It is typically stored in memory or
          secure storage mechanisms like session storage or secure HTTP-only
          cookies on the client-side. A refresh token is a long-lived credential
          used to obtain a new access token when the original one expires.
          Refresh tokens should be securely stored using mechanisms like secure
          HTTP-only cookies, encrypted local storage, or platform-provided
          secure storage to prevent unauthorized access. The specific storage
          method may depend on the platform and security requirements, but
          ensuring their protection is crucial for maintaining secure
          authentication and authorization.

          Q2:Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?
        </p>
        <p className="">
          <span className="font-semibold text-xl">Ans:</span>
          <br />
          SQL and NoSQL databases are two distinct types of database management
          systems, each with its own characteristics and use cases. SQL
          databases are based on a structured model with a predefined schema
          consisting of tables, columns, and relationships. They use SQL
          (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation and querying. SQL
          databases prioritize ACID compliance, ensuring data integrity and
          consistency. They are well-suited for applications that require
          complex queries, transactions, and strong data consistency, such as
          financial systems. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, offer
          flexibility by not enforcing a fixed schema. They employ various data
          models such as key-value, document, columnar, and graph. NoSQL
          databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance (AP)
          over strict consistency (C) according to the CAP theorem, allowing for
          eventual consistency. They excel in handling large amounts of
          unstructured or semi-structured data, real-time data processing, and
          high scalability requirements. NoSQL databases are commonly used in
          applications such as social media platforms, IoT systems, and content
          management systems. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends
          on factors such as data structure, scalability needs, consistency
          requirements, and the nature of the application. It's essential to
          evaluate these factors to determine the most suitable database
          solution.

          Q3:What is express js? What is Nest JS

          Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for
          Node.js. It provides a set of features for building web applications
          and APIs, such as routing, middleware support, and handling HTTP
          requests and responses. Express.js is known for its simplicity and
          lightweight nature, making it popular among developers for quickly
          building server-side applications. Nest.js, on the other hand, is a
          progressive, extensible, and TypeScript-based framework for building
          efficient and scalable server-side applications. It is built on top of
          Express.js and incorporates concepts from other frameworks like
          Angular. Nest.js emphasizes modular architecture, dependency
          injection, and strong typing. It provides a structured and opinionated
          approach to building server-side applications, making it suitable for
          complex and large-scale projects.

          Q4:What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?
        </p>
        <p className="">

          In MongoDB, the aggregate function is a powerful tool that allows you
          to perform advanced data processing and analysis on collections. It
          enables you to perform complex operations like filtering, grouping,
          transforming, and aggregating data using a pipeline of stages. The
          aggregate function works by processing documents in a collection
          through a series of pipeline stages. Each stage performs a specific
          operation on the data and passes the results to the next stage. The
          stages are applied in a sequential order, allowing you to build a
          series of transformations and aggregations to achieve the desired
          result. A typical aggregate pipeline consists of stages like $match
          (to filter documents), $group (to group documents based on certain
          fields), $project (to shape the output), $sort (to sort the output),
          and more. You can also use a variety of operators and expressions
          within these stages to perform calculations, transformations, and
          conditionals. The aggregate function is highly flexible and can handle
          complex data processing requirements. It leverages the MongoDB query
          language and provides a declarative way to specify the data
          transformations and aggregations needed. By using the aggregate
          function, you can efficiently analyze and summarize data stored in
          MongoDB collections.
